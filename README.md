# Research-Project

Hello! Welcome to my Research-Project, which is a repository for all code used in my Bachelor's thesis, which includes my Osprey JobFile, and R Studio Scripts for analysis and data plotting. All code will be appropriately acknoweledged where necessary.

On this page, you will find three additional files: 
1) job_k20038514.m -> The job file which tells Osprey where to find my raw data, how to process it, and where to store the results
2) LMM and correlation results.R -> The code for my main analysis, including data organisation, linear mixed model and Pearson's correlation analyses
3) DisplayingResults.R -> The code for plotting the results of my project

Please note that in order to remain anonymous, I have removed code which identifies myself. This only includes when I specify the working directories and will not affect the clarity of the code, it just won't work if I was to run it.
