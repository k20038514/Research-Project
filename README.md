# Research-Project

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page, which is a repository for all code used in my Bachelor's thesis, which includes my Osprey JobFile, and R Studio Scripts for analysis and data plotting. All code will be appropriately referenced where necessary.

Please note that in order to remain anonymous, I have removed code which identifies myself. This only includes when I specify the working directories and will not affect the clarity of the code, it just won't work if I was to run it. You probably wouldn't notice it anyway.
